        description="I started in the Xero grad programme, going through four rotations and learning about
          fullstack, front end, back end, Android and iOS skills.  
          I settled as a front-end full stack engineer when becoming an associate and as an engineer.  
          During this time, I created webpages seen by 40,000 customers a day, utilising HTML, CSS, React, Typescript and XUI (Xero's UI component library) to create, modernise and improve webpages.
          I also used C# and API endpoints to store and retrieve customer data.
          I gained practical experience in agile teams, delivering customer facing code.

          I also was a feature lead, supporting the deprecation of outdated webpages, encouraging 5k users to align with updated government regulations known as STP2.  
          I performed maintenance and reliability work, adding integration and e2e tests and updating TeamCity pipelines.
          I also mentored and onboarded three graduate engineers, helping them to become productive members of the team and teaching them skills such as React, Typescript and CSS.
          I encouraged availability by ensuring all of our pages were adequately monitored and added alerting with tools such as New Relic, Sumo Logic and Lighthouse
          I developed two webpages to improve the payroll onboarding flow, the first touchpoint for customers exploring Payroll.
          During this I conducted data-driven experiments with Mix Panel Beanie events to improve customer journeys.
          This experiment increased Payroll customer activation in the UK by 28% and 13% in NZ.
          I used Launch Darkly to control releases to customers, with some feature flags getting evaluated 10k-100k times a day.
          A highlight was a hakathon where we received the Customer Impact Award for adding a file upload section to an employee, which was the most requested feature in Payroll for multiple years.  
          I also won the Connected Workplaces Hackathon with a team of four, where we created a wellbeing hub - a dashboard for employees to easily see upcoming events, todos and summaries of their employees.

          During this time, I created a page for Rocos to monitor the health of their various services.
          I also created widgets that users could add to their dashboard to monitor their robots and made many other css improvements.  
          I gained experience working in Angular and becoming familiar with new codebases.
          A highlight was a hakathon where we added a live 360 feed to the Boston Dynamic robot dog 
          so that you could remotely view and control it live."
